# Sample Document for RAG Testing

This is a test document about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Key Concepts

1. **Machine Learning**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
2. **Neural Networks**: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks.
3. **Deep Learning**: ML techniques based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers.

## Applications

- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles

This document is used to test the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities of the agent.
